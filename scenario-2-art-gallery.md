# Scenario 2: Procedurally Generated 3D Art Gallery üñºÔ∏èüåÄ

## Concept

A virtual art gallery where the "artworks" are dynamically generated 3D abstract shapes or patterns using three.js. Each time the user "enters" a new "room" or clicks a button, a new, unique piece of 3D art is generated and displayed with interesting lighting and camera angles.

## English Requirement Description

"Develop a three.js web application that functions as a procedurally generated 3D art gallery. The core features should include:

### Core Features

#### Procedural Geometry
Generate random abstract 3D shapes or complex geometries (e.g., using combinations of basic shapes, noise functions, or L-systems).

#### Dynamic Scene Generation
Each time the user requests a new artwork (e.g., via a button click or navigating to a new "exhibit"), a new and unique 3D art piece should be created and displayed.

#### Lighting and Shading
Implement dynamic and interesting lighting (e.g., multiple colored lights, spotlights) and appropriate shaders to enhance the visual appeal of the generated art.

#### Camera Animation
Include subtle camera movements or transitions when a new artwork is presented.

### Technical Requirements

- Users should be able to navigate the gallery space
- Trigger the generation of new art pieces
- Each artwork should be unique and procedurally generated
- Dynamic lighting system with multiple light sources
- Smooth camera transitions and animations
- Gallery-like environment and atmosphere

### Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Three.js
- **Generation**: Procedural algorithms
- **Geometry**: Abstract 3D shapes and patterns
- **Lighting**: Dynamic multi-colored lighting
- **Animation**: Camera movements and transitions
- **Interaction**: Gallery navigation and artwork generation

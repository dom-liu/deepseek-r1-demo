# Scenario 3: Mini 3D Solar System Orrery üååü™ê

## Concept

A visually engaging and somewhat scientifically accurate (in terms of orbital paths and relative speeds, not necessarily scale) animated model of our solar system or a fictional planetary system. Users can click on planets to get basic information and perhaps control the simulation speed.

## English Requirement Description

"Build an interactive 3D solar system orrery using three.js. The application should:

### Core Features

#### Display Planets
Render several celestial bodies (planets, and optionally a central star and moons) with distinct textures.

#### Orbital Mechanics
Implement elliptical or circular orbital paths for each planet around the central star. Planets should orbit at different, relatively proportional speeds.

#### User Interaction
Allow users to click on a planet to display basic information (e.g., name, a short description).

#### Camera Controls
Provide users with the ability to zoom, pan, and perhaps focus on specific planets.

#### Optional Bonus
Add a control to adjust the simulation speed (e.g., slow down, speed up, or pause the planetary motion).

### Technical Requirements

- Ensure the scene is well-lit, possibly with the star emitting light
- Include a starry background
- Scientifically accurate orbital mechanics (relative speeds)
- Interactive planet information system
- Smooth camera controls and planet focusing
- Realistic lighting from central star

### Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Three.js
- **Physics**: Orbital mechanics simulation
- **Textures**: Distinct planetary textures
- **Lighting**: Central star as light source
- **Background**: Starry space environment
- **Interaction**: Clickable planets with information
- **Controls**: Speed adjustment and camera manipulation

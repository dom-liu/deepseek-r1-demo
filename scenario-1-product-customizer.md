# Scenario 1: Interactive 3D Product Customizer üõçÔ∏è‚ú®

## Concept

A web page showcasing a 3D model of a product (e.g., a sneaker, a car, or a piece of furniture). Users can interact with the model to customize various aspects like colors, materials, and possibly add or remove certain parts. Changes should be reflected in real-time on the 3D model.

## English Requirement Description

"Create a web application using three.js that loads a 3D model (e.g., in GLTF format). Implement functionality allowing users to customize the model's appearance. This should include:

### Core Features

#### Color Picker
Allow users to change the color of specific parts of the model.

#### Material Switcher
Allow users to toggle between different materials (e.g., matte, metallic, fabric) for designated sections of the model.

#### Optional Bonus
Implement the ability to add or remove predefined accessories or components on the model.

### Technical Requirements

- The user interface for customization should be intuitive
- Changes must be applied to the 3D model instantly
- Ensure smooth camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan) for model viewing
- Support GLTF format for 3D model loading
- Real-time rendering and updates

### Implementation Details

- **Framework**: Three.js
- **Model Format**: GLTF (recommended)
- **Interaction**: Real-time customization
- **Camera**: Orbit controls with zoom and pan
- **UI**: Intuitive customization interface
- **Performance**: Smooth real-time updates
